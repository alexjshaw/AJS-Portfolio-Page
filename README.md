# Overview
Having completed a 6 month, full-stack bootcamp one of my first tasks was to build myself a portfolio, and here we are.
My aim when starting this site was twofold:

 1. Come up with a design that was visually interesting without being cluttered.
 2. Continue to build my knowledge and use tools that I have not used previously.

I believe that both of these aims have been accomplished.
